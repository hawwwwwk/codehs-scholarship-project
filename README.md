# codehs-scholarship-project

**Update:** Didn't get the scholarship. Can't really pin a reason why, other than other people just being beter. I'll do better next time >:D

The purpose of my program is to be an entertaining game played from the terminal! Console Crashers main goal is to entertain. The name is a play on words of another popular game called Castle Crashers, and while the games are very different, I couldn't pass up the opportunity for a pun that amazing. In Console Crashers, you'll have the ability to fight and slay enemies and engage in humorous dialogue. The program is a clear representation of the skills that I've obtained over multiple years using object-oriented programming.
